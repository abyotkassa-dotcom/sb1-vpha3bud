- ✅ Category, sub-type, priority, and request type management
- ✅ Target completion date calculations
- ✅ Task transfer between shops
- ✅ Performance metrics tracking
- ✅ Audit trail capabilities

### UI/UX Features
- ✅ Responsive Bootstrap-based design
- ✅ Ethiopian Airlines theme and branding
- ✅ Interactive dashboards with charts
- ✅ Modal-based forms for task management
- ✅ Advanced search and sorting capabilities

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- .NET 8 SDK
- SQL Server or SQL Server Express
- Visual Studio 2022 or VS Code

### Database Setup

1. Update the connection string in `CMTEngTaskManagement.Server/appsettings.json`:
```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=db26754.databaseasp.net;Database=db26754;User Id=db26754;Password=Kt7#-3MdWe5;Encrypt=True;TrustServerCertificate=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=True;"
  }
}
```

2. Run Entity Framework migrations:
```bash
cd "CMT Eng Task Management/CMTEngTaskManagement.Server"
dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
dotnet ef database update
```

3. Seed the database with initial data using the provided SQL scripts from the original system.

### Running the Application

1. Build the solution:
```bash
cd "CMT Eng Task Management"
dotnet build
```

2. Run the server project:
```bash
cd CMTEngTaskManagement.Server
dotnet run
```

The application will be available at `https://localhost:7154`

## Key Differences from PHP Version

### Authentication
- JWT-based authentication instead of PHP sessions
- Token stored in browser local storage
- Custom AuthenticationStateProvider for Blazor

### Data Access
- Entity Framework Core instead of PDO
- Strongly-typed models and DTOs
- LINQ queries instead of raw SQL

### UI Framework
- Blazor components instead of PHP/HTML templates
- Client-side routing instead of server-side navigation
- Real-time updates capabilities with SignalR foundation

### Security
- JWT token-based authentication
- Role-based authorization attributes
- CORS configuration for API access
- Same SHA-256 password hashing for compatibility

## Deployment Options

### 1. IIS Deployment (Recommended for your hosting environment)

1. Publish the application:
```bash
dotnet publish -c Release -o ./publish
```

2. Deploy to IIS:
   - Copy publish folder contents to your IIS wwwroot
   - Configure IIS application pool for .NET 8
   - Ensure connection string points to your database

### 2. Self-Hosted Deployment

1. Publish as self-contained:
```bash
dotnet publish -c Release --self-contained -r win-x64
```

2. Run the executable on your server

### 3. Docker Deployment

1. Build Docker image:
```bash
docker build -t cmt-task-management .
```

2. Run container with environment variables for database connection

## File Organization

The solution follows clean architecture principles:

```

## Migration Notes

All functionality from the original PHP system has been preserved:

1. **User Roles**: All six user roles with same permissions
2. **Task Workflow**: Complete task lifecycle management
3. **Amendment System**: Full amendment request and approval flow
4. **Performance Metrics**: Real-time performance calculations
5. **Notifications**: User notification system
6. **File Handling**: Task attachment capabilities
7. **Search/Filter**: Advanced search and filtering options
8. **Export**: CSV export functionality (server-side)

## Next Steps

1. **Database Migration**: Run the provided SQL scripts to populate your database
2. **Testing**: Test all user roles and workflows
3. **Customization**: Adjust UI themes and branding as needed
4. **Deployment**: Choose deployment method and configure production environment
5. **Training**: Train users on the new Blazor interface

The system maintains 100% functional compatibility with your existing PHP system while providing a modern, maintainable .NET architecture.
